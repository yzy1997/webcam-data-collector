# NOTES
This the for injecting timestamp into every frame of the video, but it seems useless because when the frame loss, the video shotting stop simultaneously. If we don't take into the lossing frame videos, then we don't need this version of client.py file. Otherwise, we have to take into the videos with lossing frames.
